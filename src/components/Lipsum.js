              We are the legacy of 15 billion years of cosmic evolution. We have
              a choice. We can enhance life and come to know the universe that
              made us, or we can squander our 15 billion year heritage in
              meaningless self-destruction. What happens in the first second of
              the next cosmic year depends on what we do, here and now, with our
              intelligence, and our knowledge of the cosmos.
